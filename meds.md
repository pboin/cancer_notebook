Karl Denninger:  "Only thing for me was/is FenBen(dog dewormer). Im convinced. Hopefully, the 27th cancer doc will say again we see nothing and you have escaped the reaper.

I bought a bag of powder Amazon which came with a 222mg spoon and I sprinkle a heaping spoon of it over my eggs or buttered toast or on melted cheese. No noticeable taste for me. Do this 3 days weekly and take 4 days off. My take on the Joe Tippens protocol."

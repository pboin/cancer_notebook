# Specific Episode Notes

- [Kresser Revolution Health Podcast: Dr. Apfel and the SAGE Oncotest](https://chriskresser.com/revolutionizing-cancer-treatment-with-dr-chris-apfel/)
  - The SAGE Oncotest takes biopsy material, splits it, them applies a full panel of treatments -- just like we've done with bacteria for decades.  Interesting podcast.

- [Believe Big Podcast - Summer Replay 2 #53 Dr. Lucas Tims - Sugar and It's Role in Feeding Cancer Cells](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1892370/episodes/15394373-summer-replay-2-53-dr-lucas-tims-sugar-and-it-s-role-in-feeding-cancer-cells.mp3)
  - Lots of commentary on sugar and carbs
  - Dr. Tims says if you do carbs, there will be less impact when paired with proteins or food in general.  Handful of chips bad, but apple with good PB is better.
  - Some comments on artificial sweeteners.

- [Nutrition with Judy:  Metabolic Therapy for Cancer Patients w/ Thomas Seyfried](https://youtu.be/5uyXao8x3_s?si=oTYWbqcB6mUO81ni)
  - "Often times it's the medication that's killing the patient"
  - "The mutations you see in cancer are the result of metabolic disfunction, not the cause of the disease."
  - Changing dogma is like changing political or religious inclinations.  Very difficult and deeply-rooted.
  - Cancer cells can't survive without glucose and/or glutamine
  - Avoid fructose if possible, but it's not as bad as refined glucose.  We have engineered fruit to be over-sweet.
  - Seyfried has the mojo keytone/gluecose meter and methodology.  GKI
  - Metabolic recovery is a lot of work on the part of the patient.  Much harder than sitting for chemo.
  - If cancer is genetic?  Why did our ancestors and people before 1800s see so little cancer?  There has never been a documented case of cancer in a female chimpanzee, even though she shares 98% of our genome.
  - There are risk factors like BRCA1, but they're not predictive.  Healthy women still do fine.
  - Boston zoo said that feeding gorillas jelly donuts would be animal cruelty.
  - Be careful of processed and cured meats:  sausages, lunch meat, etc.

- [Doctor's Farmacy w/ Mark Hyman:  A Radical Dietary Approach to Cancer Treatment with Dr. Thomas Seyfried](https://pdst.fm/e/mgln.ai/e/269/pscrb.fm/rss/p/traffic.megaphone.fm/HYMANDIGITALLLC4355600507.mp3?updated=1713554815)
  - Dr. Seyfried is the OG for the Metabolic Theory
  - Glucose and glutamine are the two most important things in cancer.
  - According to the Metabolic Theory, targetted imunity drugs will always struggle with diferentiated cells, since it's the metabolic system that lets randomness creep in.
  - Cancer can only ferment -- so it's very important to manage sugar and glutamine.
  - No diet can control glutamine.  Seyfried uses drugs to 'pulse' the supression and let the body recover.
  - Some people do well on longer-term, lower-dose chemotherapies, supplemented with keto eating.

# Episode Notes

- [Believe Big Podcast - Summer Replay 2 #53 Dr. Lucas Tims - Sugar and It's Role in Feeding Cancer Cells](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1892370/episodes/15394373-summer-replay-2-53-dr-lucas-tims-sugar-and-it-s-role-in-feeding-cancer-cells.mp3)
  - Lots of commentary on sugar and carbs
  - Dr. Tims says if you do carbs, there will be less impact when paired with proteins or food in general.  Handful of chips bad, but apple with good PB is better.
  - Some comments on artificial sweeteners.
 
- [Nutrition with Judy:  Metabolic Therapy for Cancer Patients w/ Thomas Seyfried](https://youtu.be/5uyXao8x3_s?si=oTYWbqcB6mUO81ni)
  - "Often times it's the medication that's killing the patient"
  - "The mutations you see in cancer are the result of metabolic disfunction, not the cause of the disease."
  - Changing dogma is like changing political or religious inclinations.  Very difficult and deeply-rooted.
  - Cancer cells can't survive without glucose and/or glutamine
  - Avoid fructose if possible, but it's not as bad as refined glucose.  We have engineered fruit to be over-sweet.
  - Seyfried has the mojo keytone/gluecose meter and methodology.  GKI
  - Metabolic recovery is a lot of work on the part of the patient.  Much harder than sitting for chemo.
  - If cancer is genetic?  Why did our ancestors and people before 1800s see so little cancer?  There has never been a documented case of cancer in a female chimpanzee, even though she shares 98% of our genome.
  - There are risk factors like BRCA1, but they're not predictive.  Healthy women still do fine.
  - Boston zoo said that feeding gorillas jelly donuts would be animal cruelty.
  - Be careful of processed and cured meats:  sausages, lunch meat, etc.

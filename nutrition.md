Warns about antioxidants.

- [NCI:  Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient)

- [NIH: Impact of antioxidant supplementation on chemotherapeutic efficacy: a systematic review of the evidence from randomized controlled trials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367938/)
  - Conclusion: None of the trials reported evidence of significant decreases in efficacy from antioxidant supplementation during chemotherapy. Many of the studies indicated that antioxidant supplementation resulted in either increased survival times, increased tumor responses, or both, as well as fewer toxicities than controls; however, lack of adequate statistical power was a consistent limitation. Large, well-designed studies of antioxidant supplementation concurrent with chemotherapy are warranted.

### Berberine

FLCCC:  Berberine: 500-600 mg twice daily

### CoQ10

- NCI warns against this. <https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/coenzyme-q10-pdq>

This antioxidant, naturally produced by the body, protects against DNA damage, enhancing resistance and reducing strand breaks. In studies, supplementing with CoQ10 enhances recovery from DNA damage to lymphocytes—white blood cells critical for healthy immune function. CoQ10 can also mitigate DNA damage involved in the development of cardiovascular disease, and research suggests people with heart disease have significantly lower levels of CoQ10. <https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/clean-diet/food-health-news/7-supplements-to-save-your-dna/>

### Curcumin

- FLCCC:  600mg twice daily

### D3

- FLCCC protocol recommends 20,000 to 50,000 IU daily. Dosage adjust by blood levels to 25-OH level of ~100ng/ml

- Multivitamins are bringing 2,000 UI

### Curcumin ( Tumeric )

- Some positive results here. Doesn't seem to have any harm.

- <https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/curcumin-pdq>

- [NCI: Curcumin](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/curcumin-pdq)

- FLCCC:  Curcumin: (nanocurcumin) 600 mg twice daily

- [Life Extension on Curcumin](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2018/ss/curcumin-starves-cancer-cells-to-death)

### Green Tea

- FLCCC: Green tea catechins: 500-1,000 mg daily

- [NIH:  Beneficial Properties of Green Tea Catechins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7084675/)

### Melatonin

- FLCCC:  start 1 mg and increase to 20-30 mg nightly

- [Life Extension: Melatonin - Potential Anti-Cancer Effects](https://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2024/11/melatonins-potential-anti-cancer-effects)

- NCI: Melatonin is a hormone produced endogenously that has been used as a CAM supplement (along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy) for targeting tumor activity and for reducing treatment-related symptoms, primarily for solid tumors.

Several studies have shown tumor response to, or disease control with, chemotherapy alongside oral melatonin, as opposed to chemotherapy alone. One study has shown tumor response with melatonin in conjunction with radiation therapy.[18-23] The combination of melatonin and chemotherapy may, in fact, increase survival time by up to 5 years compared with chemotherapy alone. However, another study did not demonstrate increased survival with melatonin, but did demonstrate improved quality of life.[24]

### N-acetylcysteine ( NAC )

- Also known as NAC, N-acetylcysteine is necessary for the production of glutathione—the body’s “master antioxidant” that fights free radical damage and protects DNA. NAC may mitigate genetic changes involved in the development of cancer, and many studies suggest it significantly lessens the risk of various kinds of cancer. <https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/clean-diet/food-health-news/7-supplements-to-save-your-dna/>

### Probiotics

- [Slick sheet from Dieticians in Integrative and Functional Medicine: Probiotics and Prebiotics](./files/pro-prebiotics.pdf) Good general reference, including a recipe for Green Cabbage, Carrot, and Ginger Kraut.

- " Strong research has shown that probiotic supplementation during radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both is well tolerated and can help prevent radiation- and chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially in those receiving radiation to the abdomen.[14-16] If a patient is undergoing radiation to the abdomen or receiving a chemotherapy agent with diarrhea as a common side effect, starting a probiotic supplement upon initiation of therapy could be beneficial. Evidence is also emerging for possible benefits of probiotics for immunotherapy-induced toxicities, particularly in the colon."

### Turkey Tail Mushrooms

<https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/mushrooms-pdq>

### Quercitin

Found in capers, green tea, apples, and onions.  Blueberries, black currants, black elderberries, and lingonberries.[1]

Touted as most powerful flavinoid known to man.[1]

  - " Quercetin is the most common bioflavonoid that people consume, and is the most active of the bioflavonoids in laboratory experiments. It is known to act as an antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals that can cause cellular and DNA damage. Quercetin is thought to have anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting the release of substances that mediate the inflammatory response, such as histamine. Presently, considerable laboratory data support the concept of quercetin as an anticancer compound, but it is still unclear from clinical trials whether this effect occurs in the human body. Because of its antioxidant effects, quercetin may interfere with the actions of certain chemotherapy drugs." <https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/quercetin>

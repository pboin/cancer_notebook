These include Thomas Seyfried (Cancer as a Metabolic Disease), Otto Warburg (The Metabolism of Tumors), Jane McLelland (How to Starve Cancer), Travis Christofferson (Tripping over the Truth), and Nasha Winter and Jess Higgins
Kelley (The Metabolic Approach to Cancer: Integrating deep nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and nontoxic bio-individualized therapies). I am also grateful for groups like Anticancer Fund and the Repurposing Drugs in Oncology (ReDO) (Cancer-Care-2024-03-29-v1.pdf)

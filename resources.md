## Books

### My Must-Reads

- **[Notes from the Valley: A Spiritual Travelogue through Cancer](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Valley-Spiritual-Travelogue-through/dp/0802412548/)**, Andy McQuitty ( 4.7 / 60 )
  - Fundamentally important book about Christian understanding of mortality, suffering, and the Lord's will.

- **[Beating Cancer With Nutrition:  Using Nutrition and Other Modalities to Improve Quality and Quantity of Life for Medically Treated Cancer Patients](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1735234702/)**, by Patrick Quillin ( 4.6 / 144 )
  - Good references in end notes.  Tons of additional reading.
  - Wide coverage and easy to read in a layout similar to a textbook.
  - Very well organized and easy to refer back to.

- **[The Metabolic Approach to Cancer:  Integrating Deep Nutrition, the Ketogenic Diet, and Nontoxic Bio-Individualized Therapies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1603586865/)**, by Winters and Kelley ( 4.7 / 1118 )
  - Deep and technical. Some bio-chemistry paragraphs.
  - Worth reading, but more work to read than Quillin's book.

- **[Keto for Cancer: Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Targeted Nutritional Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603587012/)**, by Miriam Kalamian EdM MS CNS ( 4.6 / 695 )
  - With a foreword by Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, PhD and contributions from Thomas Seyfried, PhD, author of Cancer as a Metabolic Disease; Miriam Kalamian, EdM, MS, CNS, author of Keto for Cancer; and Beth Zupec Kania, consultant nutritionist of The Charlie Foundation.
  - Standard American Diet: Fat/Protein/Carb is 20-30/10-35/45-65
  - Ketogenic Diet: Fat/Protein/Carb is 78-86/8-12/2-6
  - Comparison and contrast of several diets: Atkins, Servan-Schreiber, Budwig, Gerson, vegan, Mediteranean, paleo
  - Recommends limiting keto proteins to 0.8 grams per kg of ideal body weight.  ( 85kg * 0.8g = 68g = 3 oz. )
  - Protein yields are not weights!  58g of chicken breast, 65g of ground beef, 65g of salmon, and 3 large eggs all yield 18g of protein. p. 206
  - Very nice list of resources as an appendix.
  
- **[Tripping over the Truth: How the Metabolic Theory of Cancer Is Overturning One of Medicine's Most Entrenched Paradigms](https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-over-Truth-Overturning-Entrenched/dp/160358935X/)**, by Travis Christofferson ( 4.7 / 1283 )
  - Different than the other books, this is a long story about the history of oncology:  how we got where we are.
  - Details chemo and how it works.
  - Writing is complex and in certain sections.  Still very interesting.
  - Central thread is the debate between SMT ( somatic mutation theory ) and failures in the body's metabolic system.
  - A chronology of Warburg, Seyfried, and others and how their work evolved over time.
  - There is no requirement for SMT or Genetic theories to be exclusivly 'right'.  They are probably interrelated.
  - Refers to 'Care Oncology Clinic', which supplements traditional med treatments.

## People

Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the authors of several books on metabolic oncology that were very useful in guiding my thinking. These include Thomas Seyfried (Cancer as a Metabolic Disease), Otto Warburg (The Metabolism of Tumors), Jane McLelland (How to Starve Cancer), Travis Christofferson (Tripping over the Truth), and Nasha Winter and Jess Higgins
Kelley (The Metabolic Approach to Cancer: Integrating deep nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and nontoxic bio-individualized therapies). I am also grateful for groups like Anticancer Fund and the Repurposing Drugs in Oncology (ReDO) (Cancer-Care-2024-03-29-v1.pdf)

- Kresser blog post talking about keto and fasting potential. "If I was diagnosed with cancer or one of my relatives or friends were diagnosed, I would certainly put the ketogenic diet and fasting at the top of the list of potential treatments to investigate because I see a high potential for benefit and very little downside"

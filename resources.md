## Books

### My Must-Reads

- **[Notes from the Valley: A Spiritual Travelogue through Cancer](https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Valley-Spiritual-Travelogue-through/dp/0802412548/)**, Andy McQuitty ( 4.7 / 60 )
  - Fundamentally important book about Christian understanding of mortality, suffering, and the Lord's will.

- **[Beating Cancer With Nutrition:  Using Nutrition and Other Modalities to Improve Quality and Quantity of Life for Medically Treated Cancer Patients](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1735234702/)**, by Patrick Quillin ( 4.6 / 144 )
  - Good references in end notes.  Tons of additional reading.
  - Wide coverage and easy to read in a layout similar to a textbook.
  - Very well organized and easy to refer back to.

- **[The Metabolic Approach to Cancer:  Integrating Deep Nutrition, the Ketogenic Diet, and Nontoxic Bio-Individualized Therapies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1603586865/)**, by Winters and Kelley ( 4.7 / 1118 )
  - Deep and technical. Some bio-chemistry paragraphs.
  - Worth reading, but more work to read than Quillin's book.

- **[Keto for Cancer: Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy as a Targeted Nutritional Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603587012/)**, by Miriam Kalamian EdM MS CNS ( 4.6 / 695 )
  - With a foreword by Dr. Dominic D'Agostino, PhD and contributions from Thomas Seyfried, PhD, author of Cancer as a Metabolic Disease; Miriam Kalamian, EdM, MS, CNS, author of Keto for Cancer; and Beth Zupec Kania, consultant nutritionist of The Charlie Foundation.
  - Standard American Diet: Fat/Protein/Carb is 20-30/10-35/45-65
  - Ketogenic Diet: Fat/Protein/Carb is 78-86/8-12/2-6
  - Comparison and contrast of several diets: Atkins, Servan-Schreiber, Budwig, Gerson, vegan, Mediteranean, paleo
  - Recommends limiting keto proteins to 0.8 grams per kg of ideal body weight.  ( 85kg * 0.8g = 68g = 3 oz. )
  - Protein yields are not weights!  58g of chicken breast, 65g of ground beef, 65g of salmon, and 3 large eggs all yield 18g of protein. p. 206
  - Very nice list of resources as an appendix.
  
- **[Tripping over the Truth: How the Metabolic Theory of Cancer Is Overturning One of Medicine's Most Entrenched Paradigms](https://www.amazon.com/Tripping-over-Truth-Overturning-Entrenched/dp/160358935X/)**, by Travis Christofferson ( 4.7 / 1283 )
  - Different than the other books, this is a long story about the history of oncology:  how we got where we are.
  - Details chemo and how it works.
  - Writing is complex and in certain sections.  Still very interesting.
  - Central thread is the debate between SMT ( somatic mutation theory ) and failures in the body's metabolic system.
  - A chronology of Warburg, Seyfried, and others and how their work evolved over time.
  - There is no requirement for SMT or Genetic theories to be exclusivly 'right'.  They are probably interrelated.
  - Refers to 'Care Oncology Clinic', which supplements traditional med treatments.
  - *"Slocum percolated with enthusiasm as he handed me a paper published in January 2016 by the ChemoThermia team detailing the experience using Metabolically Supported Chemotherapy ( MCST ) in pancreatic cancer. In their comparison of patients whoe had received the chemothereapy regiment known as FOLFIRINOX plus MCST to those who received FOLFIRINOX alonge, they found an improved median survival rate:  19.5 months in the patients receiving supplemental MCST therapy compared to 11.1 months in those receiving FOLFIRINOX alone. The one-year survival rate for those in the first group ( FOLFIRINOX plus MCST ) was 82.5 percent, compared to 48.4 percent in the second group ( FOLFIRINOX alone ), an amazing increas. Slocum also noted that 54 percent of the patnients included in this study remained healthy, alive, and free of disease progression at time of publication. "We will be rebublishing our results next year, and because so many patients are still alive our median survival is going to be over 20 months," marveled Slocum."*

## People

Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the authors of several books on metabolic oncology that were very useful in guiding my thinking. These include Thomas Seyfried (Cancer as a Metabolic Disease), Otto Warburg (The Metabolism of Tumors), Jane McLelland (How to Starve Cancer), Travis Christofferson (Tripping over the Truth), and Nasha Winter and Jess Higgins
Kelley (The Metabolic Approach to Cancer: Integrating deep nutrition, the ketogenic diet, and nontoxic bio-individualized therapies). I am also grateful for groups like Anticancer Fund and the Repurposing Drugs in Oncology (ReDO) (Cancer-Care-2024-03-29-v1.pdf)

#### Testing and Genetics

- [RGCC: Research Genetic Cancer Center](https://myrgcc.com/)
  - Measures 'circulating tumor cells' and 'circulating stem cells'.
  - Does a genetic analysis of cancer markers and will test cancer's sensitivity
    to a variety of natural and chemo agents.  Also gives treatment recommendations
    based on genetics of cancer.
  - ![alt text](/images/291086168_133208666059904_290948550422893092_n.jpg)
  - Tippens himself doesn't say RGCC is credible:  
  "Their chemosensitivity test involves extracting the "5-200" circulating tumour
  cells (CTCs) from the 25mL of blood submitted, and culturing those approximately
  100 cells up to a population of "trillions" in "just 24-36 hours". Finding the
  "5-200" needles in the haystack that is a 25mL blood sample, would be very, very
  difficult, but not impossible. Whereas producing "trillions" of cancer cells
  from approximately 100 cells in "just 24-36 hours" is completely impossible. He
  claims he can speed that up to 20 minutes (from one day) and based on the
  research I've done, I find that highly unlikely. If anyone can show me research
  or proof that it is possible, I'd love to see it. Cancer cell-lines are well
  known, their typical doubling-time is approximately daily, i.e. the number of
  cells doubles every 24 hours: if you started with 100 cells, after 1 day you'd
  have 200 cells, after 2 days 400, after 3 days 800, et cetera. It would take 34
  days to reach a "trillion" cells. (In 2013 a laboratory grew a few cow-muscle
  cells into a beef-burger: the quarter-pounder only contained about 1/10th of a
  trillion cells, but took three months to grow in the lab and cost over $300K.
  A blood test will not detect tumor cells unless it is a blood-borne cancer
  (generally leukemia or lymphoma), or the cancer has metastasized into the blood
  from its original organ. <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5060940/>"
  - "The RGCC test is bullshit! I paid for the all of their text for a year..
  at follow up it told me my circulating tumor cell count went down
  drastically.. shortly after I went to stage 4 with tumors in several spots.."
